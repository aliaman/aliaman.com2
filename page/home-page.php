	  	      Born in Hyderabad, Pakistan. My parents are University Professors; both Ph.Ds!,
	  	      My mom just retired and my dad teaches marketing and commerce, here is his 
	  	      <a target="blank" href="http://jalbani.szabist.edu.pk">profile</a>. Married to my wife Aisha, we have
	  	      an adorable little girl Haya <i>(it means 'modesty' in Urdu and 'life' in Arabic)</i>. 
	  	      I have spent my childhood in Khairpur, a little town in Pakistan famous for its abundant date orchards
	  	      and the legendary <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kot_Diji_Fort">'Kot Digi' fort.</a> 
	  	      <p>
	  	      Khairpur's economy thrives on its abundant fields of date trees. I had one such tree in my backyard
	  	      and always thought that it looked better than a palm tree.
	  	      I visited Edinburgh in the late 80s, tagged along with my father who had to 
	  	      do his research; lived there for 5 years. Came back and joined a cadet college (military school) 
	  	      and spent the 5 most eventful years of my life. This college is located 20 miles from Hyderabad on 
	  	      the west bank of the river Indus near the village of Petaro <i>(it means 'The Stomach of the
	  	      River')</i>. Here is a link to <a target="blank" href="http://www.petaro.org/">Petaro</a>.
	  	      Petaro was administered by the navy, so the management took special care in making sure that
	  	      every cadet knew how to swim. They had a simple yet effective method to teach swimming. They used to
	  	      push a novice swimmer in the deep part of the pool, and when the poor lad was about to see light
	  	      at the end of the tunnel, they would allow him hold on to dear life via a pole or a boey. 
	  	      I have applied the same methodology whenever I begin to learn something new; 'Jump in the Deep'. 
	  	      It works.

	  	      Graduated from Petaro in 2001, moved to Karachi in 2004 and got admission in SZABIST Karachi
	  	      in thier Computer Science graduation program. I enjoyed taking hardware classes and loved
	  	      translating Karnaugh maps to messy soldered circuits. I almost switched my field to hardware
	  	      if it wasn't for a friend of mine showed me his impressive e-commerce website which he wrote in 2004
	  	      <i>(pre Web 2.0 days)</i> for his Masters
	  	      Program. I remember mentioning to him <i>'wouldn't it be great if you didn't have to go to a
	  	      different page to create, retrieve, update and deleting a record?'.</i> I am glad that the world
	  	      agrees with me now. Graduated with my Masters in CS in 2005.

	  	      I moved to California in 2007. My first job here was at the 
	  	      <a target="blank" href="http://www.baaqmd.gov/">BAAQMD</a> (Bay Area Air Quality Management
	  	      District). For those of you in the Bay Area that aren't familiar with this acronym; this is
	  	      the government agency that decides when to declare a 'Spare the Air' day or when its a good 
	  	      time for a 'Bike to Work' day. If anyone of you have ever got a ticket for burning wood on a cold
	  	      winter night, I might have to take a fraction of the blame. Anyhow I was hired to design thier new system which they
	  	      were planning to build for compliance and enforcement.
	  	      I am currently working for <a target="blank" href='http://www.turnhere.com'>Turnhere</a>, a very exciting 
	  	      and already profitable startup. Our primary product is to offer TV quality video advertisements for the Internet
	  	      and it's hosting and distribution. Our primary customer is small businesses but we also have made excellent
	  	      products for multinational corporations. Visit the 'Get Video for your Business' section 
	  	      if you would like to learn more about Turnhere or if you would like to order a video.
